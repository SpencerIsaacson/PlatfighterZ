# PlatfighterZ
PlatfighterZ is the codename for an as-yet untitled platform fighting game in the vein of Super Smash Bros. or Rivals of Aether, written using nothing but C, C#, .NET, and a handful of low-level APIs consumed via P/Invoke. It is currently targeted at Windows, but may ultimately end up targeting Linux as well as a baremetal implementation for the Raspberry Pi 3 hardware.
