# PlatfighterZ
PlatfighterZ is the codename for an as-yet untitled platform fighting game in the vein of Super Smash Bros. or Rivals of Aether, written using nothing but C#, Mono, and a handful of low-level APIs consumed via P/Invoke. It will target at minimum Linux and the Raspberry PI, and may also eventually run on Windows and Mac.
